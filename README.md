This project is [CharityWare](http://charityware.info/), which means you are asked to donate at least $5 US to a charity of your choice if you are using this software.

## Comparing Directory and Files
The module that compares directories and files supports 2 views:
- Directories and Files
- Files Summary

### Directories and Files
This view has the usual side by side view of folders and files being highlighted when
they have been added, deleted, or changed in the **right view** when compared to the **left view**.
You can double click each directory to browe into the directory structure or use the arrow up button
in the toolbar to browse back up in the structure.

### Files Summary
This view shows only file that have been deleted, inserted, or changed in the **right view**
when compared to the **left view**. You can use the tooltip or context menu entries to see
the actual path of each file or open in the Explorer etc.
